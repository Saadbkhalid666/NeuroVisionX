## Overview

**NeuroVisionX** is a cutting-edge web application that leverages AI-powered computer vision to provide **real-time face and hand detection**. Built with **ReactJS** for frontend development and **TailwindCSS** for responsive styling, this project demonstrates advanced capabilities of modern AI frameworks integrated directly into the browser.

The platform features:

- **Face Detection** ‚Äì Detects detailed facial features including eyes, eyebrows, iris, lips, etc., and predicts age, gender, and emotion.  
- **Hand Detection** ‚Äì Recognizes hand gestures using WebAssembly (WASM) and provides confidence levels for predictions.

## Features

### Face Detection

- Detects **faces** in real-time with high accuracy.  
- Predicts **age** and **gender** using `age_gender_model`.  
- Recognizes **emotions** (happy, sad, etc.) via `face_expression_model`.  
- Generates **68 facial landmarks** using `face_landmark_68_model`.  
- Detects faces efficiently with `tiny_face_detector`.  
- Built using **@mediapipe/tasks-vision** for landmark and model implementation.

### Hand Detection

- Recognizes **gestures** using `gesture_recognizer.task`.  
- Predicts the **confidence level** of gestures.  
- Implements **landmarks and connectors** via **@mediapipe/tasks-vision**.  
- Optimized with **WebAssembly (WASM)** for fast and smooth performance in the browser.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** ReactJS  
- **Styling & Responsiveness:** TailwindCSS  
- **AI / Computer Vision:** Mediapipe, WASM, @mediapipe/tasks-vision
